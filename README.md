**Isaac Lab** is a GPU-accelerated, open-source framework designed to unify and simplify robotics research workflows,
such as reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and motion planning. Built on [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/index.html),
it combines fast and accurate physics and sensor simulation, making it an ideal choice for sim-to-real
transfer in robotics.

Isaac Lab provides developers with a range of essential features for accurate sensor simulation, such as RTX-based
cameras, LIDAR, or contact sensors. The framework's GPU acceleration enables users to run complex simulations and
computations faster, which is key for iterative processes like reinforcement learning and data-intensive tasks.
Moreover, Isaac Lab can run locally or be distributed across the cloud, offering flexibility for large-scale deployments.

A detailed description of Isaac Lab can be found in our [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04831).

## Key Features

Isaac Lab offers a comprehensive set of tools and environments designed to facilitate robot learning:

- **Robots**: A diverse collection of robots, from manipulators, quadrupeds, to humanoids, with more than 16 commonly available models.
- **Environments**: Ready-to-train implementations of more than 30 environments, which can be trained with popular reinforcement learning frameworks such as RSL RL, SKRL, RL Games, or Stable Baselines. We also support multi-agent reinforcement learning.
- **Physics**: Rigid bodies, articulated systems, deformable objects
- **Sensors**: RGB/depth/segmentation cameras, camera annotations, IMU, contact sensors, ray casters.


## Getting Started

### Getting Started with Open-Source Isaac Sim

Isaac Sim is now open source and available on GitHub! To run Isaac Lab with the open source Isaac Sim repo,
ensure you are using the `feature/isaacsim_5_0` branch.
